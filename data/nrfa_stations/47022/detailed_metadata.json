This impermeable geology with steep topography leads to a reasonably rapid catchment response to storm events. However as a result of the artificial influences response may be considered muted compared to the catchment pre- china clay mining. No major changes to catchment.",

The river flow regime may be affected by these works in a number of ways including; cross-catchment transfers, the potential for attenuation of catchment runoff in lagoons; changes in topography caused by the development of waste tips, which could increase catchment steepness leading to faster runoff; and the permeability of the soils may be reduced due to compaction and clay being brought to the surface. With the exception of these areas of china clay works, the upper catchment is predominantly rural containing only the small settlements of Lee Moor and Wotter.",
